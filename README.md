# AI-Browser-Agent
Developed an AI-powered agent that autonomously interacts with websites using the Playwright browser automation framework. The agent can perform dynamic web actions such as clicking buttons, filling out forms, scraping data, and navigating pages based on user prompts or predefined goals. Integrated natural language inputs to translate commands into browser tasks, simulating real user behavior and enabling intelligent task automation.
